          description: 'Kootenay National Park lies in the southeastern part of British Columbia and occupies an area of approximately 1,406 square kilometers. This area showcases many impressive landscapes including glaciers, mountains and chasms. While most visitors enjoy the scenery along Highway 93, there are various hiking trails within the park limits. Perhaps one of the most attractive activities in the park is the Radium Hot Springs where visitors can soak. Kootenay is also home to many species such as mountain goats, whitetail deer and the Northwestern Wolf. (Kootenay Rockies, 2021).',

            description: 'Northwestern wolves (C. lupus occidentalis) are a subspecies of gray wolf in North America. There are many colour variations including black, white and tan. They are found in Alaska, to the Northwestern United States in rock mountain areas. This apex predator lives in packs of 6-12 with distinct hierarchical roles. Wolves are most active at dawn and dusk and can spend up to 10 hours of their day on the move. These animals have a varied diet including hares, caribou and beavers. Northwestern wolves are threatened due to trapping as well as habitat fragmentation.',
